# Nehal Ansh Srivastava



I am a Ph.D. candidate in the School of Sustainable Engineering and the Built Environment at Arizona State University (ASU) specializing in Hydrosystems Engineering. My research focuses on different aspects of urban hydrology ranging from climate to infrastructure. It addresses a fundamental challenge in urban resilience: understanding how extreme weather events propagate through interconnected infrastructure systems that were designed to operate independently.

I work at the intersection of climate science, infrastructure modeling, and resilience engineering, developing integrated approaches that capture the full spectrum of urban hydrological systemsâ€”from the climate variables during storms that cause damage and trigger cascading failures across power, stormwater, and transportation networks. My work challenges the traditional siloed approach to infrastructure design by creating mechanistic frameworks that represent the complex interdependencies between systems and their responses to spatiotemporally variable climate forcings. By combining high-resolution modeling of climate extremes with computational simulation of infrastructure behavior, I aim to transform how cities anticipate, prepare for, and adapt to the intensifying storms of a changing climate, ultimately contributing to more resilient and sustainable urban environments.

I am affiliated with the Hydroclimate & Infrastructure Research Lab with Prof. Giuseppe Mascaro and the Resilient Infrastructure Laboratory with Prof. Mikhail Chester.
